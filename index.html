											<p> Newflix is a Netflix Clone, a full stack project that I worked on to sharpen my skills in front and backend development. 
												The function clone allows for users to watch and stream movie trailers once registered and signed in. 
												The backend database is developed on PostgreSQL, the backend is developed through Ruby on Rails, and the 
												frontend is developed using React/Redux. Cloud storage for images and videos is supported through Amazon AWS S3.

								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>

							<!-- <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></a> -->

							<p>
								I am a 2017 graduate of the University of California, Irvine with a Bachelor’s of Science degree in Biology.  
								Upon graduating, I took on a Case Manager role at a well-known biotechnology company whilst continuing to 
								explore new interests.  Eventually, I was introduced to the world of computer technology and surveyed the 
								industry via self-education and browsing through online tutorials.  I found the field to be very involving 
								and decided to enroll at the App Academy coding boot camp for my formal education and training.  There I 
								built a strong foundation in full stack development and learned key concepts in the science of computer 
								programming.  After completion of coursework there, I aimed to pursue a Software Engineering career path.  
								Through projects and freelance work, I continue to learn and challenge my skills as a Full Stack Engineer 
								and am always looking for new opportunities to learn new skills and sharpen tools I already have. 
								<br>
								<br>
								My goal is to find a position as a Software Engineer at a company that is looking to produce technologies 
								that make a difference in people’s lives.  My ultimate, long term goal is to develop meaningful technologies 
								of my own someday. 
								<br>
								<br>
								When I am not busy learning new technical skills, working on projects, or doing freelance work, I like to 
								spend my time outdoors, hiking, playing golf, or snowboarding.  Although I was an avid basketball player 
								and competed up until the varsity high school level, I have recently become more interested in boxing and 
								mixed martial arts, thus, I also delve in such training when I have free time.
